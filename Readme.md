# 🐍 Snake Game

A feature-rich Snake game implementation built with Python and Turtle graphics, showcasing professional software architecture, progressive difficulty, and persistent high score tracking.

## 🎮 Advanced Game Features

- **Smooth snake movement** with responsive arrow key controls
- **Self-collision detection** - Game ends when snake hits its own body
- **Progressive speed increase** - Game gets faster as you score higher
- **Persistent high score system** - Your best scores are saved between sessions

- **Professional UI** - Clean layouts with celebration animations
- **Dynamic food system** with boundary-safe random positioning
- **Anti-reverse logic** - Prevents accidental backwards movement
- **Multiple game over conditions** - Boundary collision vs self-collision

## 🏗️ Professional Architecture

This project demonstrates **enterprise-level software architecture** with complete separation of concerns:

```

├── 🍎 food.py            → Food positioning & boundary-safe placement  
├── 🖼️ game_display.py    → UI, graphics, scoring & game over screens

```

### Design Patterns & Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each class has one clear, focused purpose
- **Encapsulation** - Internal state properly managed and hidden behind clean APIs
- **Composition over Inheritance** - Game coordinates specialized component objects
- **File I/O Management** - Safe, error-resistant persistent storage
- **Clean Code Architecture** - Readable, maintainable, professional-quality code

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Turtle graphics (included with Python standard library)

### Installation & Quick Start
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the SimpleGame directory
3. Run the game:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

### Game Controls
- **↑ Arrow Key** - Move Up
- **↓ Arrow Key** - Move Down  
- **← Arrow Key** - Move Left
- **→ Arrow Key** - Move Right
- **Click** - Close game over screen and exit

## 🎯 How to Play & Game Mechanics

1. **Start the game** - Run `python snake_game.py`
2. **Control the green snake** - Use arrow keys to navigate around the white game area
3. **Eat the red food** - Guide snake head to food to grow and score
4. **Avoid collisions** - Don't hit the boundary walls or your own snake body
5. **Challenge yourself** - Game speed increases every 5 points for added difficulty
6. **Beat your high score** - Scores are automatically saved and displayed

## 🏆 Game Rules & Scoring

- **Movement**: Snake moves continuously in the current direction
- **Growth**: Each food item increases score by 1 and adds a body segment  
- **Speed**: Game speed increases every 5 points (maximum challenge at score 25+)
- **Game Over Conditions**:
  - Hitting boundary walls
  - Snake head colliding with its own body
- **High Scores**: Best scores are automatically saved to `high_score.txt`
- **New Records**: Special celebration screen for beating your personal best

## 🎨 Customization Options

The modular architecture makes customization straightforward:

### Modify Game Difficulty
```python
# In snake_game.py - __init__ method
self.GAME_SPEED = 0.05  # Start faster (lower = faster)

# In snake_game.py - update_game_speed method  
self.GAME_SPEED = max(0.01, 0.1 - (self.score // 3) * 0.01)  # Faster progression
```

### Change Visual Appearance
```python
# In snake.py - __init__ method
self.head.color("blue")  # Change snake head color

# In food.py - __init__ method  
self.food.color("yellow")  # Change food color

# In game_display.py - setup_screen method
self.window.bgcolor("black")  # Change background color
```

### Adjust Game Area & Scoring
```python
# In snake_game.py - __init__ method
self.BOUNDARY = 200  # Smaller, more challenging game area

# In food.py - relocate method
# Modify scoring values and mechanics
```
